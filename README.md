# Seoul Bike Rentals to Provide Recommendations for Implementing a Dynamic Demand Based Pricing Model

Collaborated with 3 students at the University of Southern California to complete this project.

What three variables affect the usage pattern of shared bike rentals the most in South Korea; to what degree do they affect the decision process?

Using this knowledge can we predict bike rental usage so we can create a demand based price model. This will maximize revenue for the bike rental company as well as increase bike usage in the city.
